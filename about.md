I’m passionate about everything related, directly or indirectly, to Microsoft technologies and services such as Active Directory, MECM, and Microsoft Azure. I’m also deeply interested in the internal workings of Windows, a skill commonly referred to as Windows Internals, and in the potential abuses of some of its features. I’d like to give a shout-out to **Pavel Yosifovich** and **Uriel Kosayev** for their absolutely outstanding work. I also aim to become a Microsoft MVP, it’s a personal goal of mine.
