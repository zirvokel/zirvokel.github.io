title: "Bring-Your-Own WER (BYO-WER): Exploiting WerFaultSecure.exe to Dump LSASS and Suspend EDR on Windows 11 24H2"
categories: windows
---

Windows 11 24H2 quietly changed the threat landscape around LSASS by widening the blast radius of Windows Error Reporting (WER). Recent research shows that WerFaultSecure.exe, a trusted crash handling component, can be conscripted in Bring Your Own WER and EDR Freeze style attacks to obtain credential material from LSASS and momentarily starve endpoint sensors, while riding on legitimate and often PPL adjacent trust paths and sanctioned APIs. This article dissects the internals that make that possible, not to teach exploitation but to arm defenders and researchers with a precise mental model. We will map WERâ€™s process tree, job objects, dump policies, and DLL load behavior; contrast WerFault and WerFaultSecure semantics; examine how LSASS protection (RunAsPPL) interacts with handle brokerage and dump providers; and enumerate the observable seams: image lineage, token and protection levels, handle opens to LSASS, MiniDump* call surfaces, ETW and WER telemetry, registry and GPO pivots such as LocalDumps, and module load artifacts such as DbgHelp and comsvcs. You will get detection hypotheses that are Sigma ready, hardening levers such as WDAC, AppLocker, and ASR, constrained crash dump policy, tamper protections, and validation guidance for a blue team lab. The goal is simple: turn a flashy and recent tradecraft meme into rigorous detection engineering so that when adversaries bring their own WER, your telemetry and controls make sure they go home empty handed.
